Our primary accountability is to people living in poverty and injustice, but we also balance our accountabilities to donors, supporters, staff and other stakeholders.    ActionAid UK’s income comes from a variety of sources including from our 135,000 individual supporters, trusts and foundations, and institutions like DfID, and the EU. Ongoing regular donations from the public represent a particularly critical element of our funding mix - both in terms of proportion of our global income, but also in terms of its potential for both transformational and focused change.  We use our funding mix holistically to deliver results in the communities in which we work.  In addition, we use unrestricted income for activities which support the International Secretariat which supports 46 countries across the ActionAid Federation. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 we raised £63.7 million, seeing a seven per cent increase in our income.  For every £10 of the money we raised, £7.54 was spent on our charitable activity – £7.00 on our activities overseas and 54 pence in the UK on education outreach to schools and on campaigning. Of the remainder, £1.85 was spent on fundraising and 61 pence on UK support costs. \r\n\r\n \r\nActionAid UK’s data that’s published to the IATI registry is summarised under the six categories above as this corresponds directly with our Trustee Report & Accounts for 2013 (and is therefore based on audited data): \r\n\r\nhttp://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/trustees-report-and-accounts.  \r\n\r\nAs we align our IATI reporting with our Trustee Report & Accounts, the bulk of our reporting to IATI is annual.  We report on DfID contracts quarterly.\r\n \r\n",

Please contact transparency@actionaid.org if you have any comments or queries.\r\n\r\nAs our income comes from hundreds of thousands of individual people, community groups, trusts and foundations, we have not published their names as we do not have their permission to disclose their identity and details.  We therefore have anonymised the data published to the IATI registry where that’s appropriate.  Naturally we have disclosed information relating to official income from organisations such as DfID, EU, ECHO, Comic Relief, and Big Lottery.\r\n\r\nOur income from private individuals (committed giving) involves regular ongoing cash or direct debit payments and a large proportion of our loyal supporter base stay with us for many years.  However, the IATI data format requires to enter start and end dates.  Given that it is not easy to represent an ongoing income stream in IATI (and after having taken advice from IATI on how best to do this), we have stated start and end dates of 1st January and 31st December against all committed giving.\r\n"

				"about": "A Brief Introduction to BASE\r\n\r\nBASE – Our History\r\n\r\nThe origins of Backward Society Education (BASE) are to be found in a pioneering group of young activists who established the Charpate Club in January 1985.  It was during their traditional Tharu New Year meeting in the village of Dumrigaon in Dang that the thirty four young people, including our founder Dill Bahadur Chaudhary, gathered together to discuss the problem of kamaiya bonded labor.  After raising 700 rupees through cultural shows, the Charpate Club went on to become BASE in 1990, and to lead the fight against the exploitative kamaiya system which was finally abolished on 17 July 2000.  After this monumental event BASE continued to work for the education and rehabilitation of the freed-kamaiyas, as well as people from other marginalized communities.  BASE has received international recognition for its work, and Dilli Chaudhary has won many awards including the 1994 Reebok Human Rights Award and the 2002 Anti Slavery Award. sought \r\n\r\nBASE – The NGO\r\n\r\nBASE continues in its commitment to fight against illiteracy, poverty and social and political discrimination amongst all marginalized communities.  Our aim is to transform the outlook of downtrodden people as well as their oppressors.  We currently operate in eight districts in the mid and far western regions of Nepal, those being Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali, Kanchanpur, Salyan, Surkhet and Rukum.  However, we are now considering expanding our projects into other districts.  Our main areas of work include formal and non-formal education, ensuring and sustaining rights for freed-kamaiyas, livelihood support, child labor elimination, support for sustainable democracy, human rights violation monitoring, conflict mitigation, water and sanitation, environmental sustainability, disaster preparedness and response, infrastructure support, the protection and promotion of traditional and indigenous cultures, and support for children associated with armed groups.  BASE hires its staff primarily from the local communities of indigenous and marginalized people it serves, and in doing so it works to strengthen indigenous capabilities. Advance\r\n\r\nBASE – The Social Movement\r\n\r\nBASE is not just an NGO but one of the largest social movements in South Asia.  We have a membership of over 200,000 people, of which about 29,000 are actively engaged in voluntary community work.  BASE’s membership is organized through a network of district committees, area committees, village committees, women’s awareness committees and youth awareness committees, all operating at their own respective level and in their own areas.  These grassroots committee members are democratically elected every five years, and they provide the strategies and ideas to keep BASE in touch with the current needs of our communities.  The committees also play a crucial role in monitoring and evaluation, troubleshooting, coordinating with national and international agencies, and communication and exposure of BASE in the diplomatic sphere.  The power of BASE’s membership is even further enhanced by hundreds of child clubs, women’s groups, income generation groups and other community organizations.\r\n\r\nBackward Society Education (BASE), Tulsipur Municipality-6, Dang, Rapti Zone, Nepal \r\nT +977 82 520055, 82 520312 F +977 82 522212 E info@nepalbase.org W www.nepalbase.org\r\n\r\n",

Five years after the struggle, the bonded labor system was officially abolished in Nepal following the government committed to rehabilitate and provide them compensation in terms of land, creation of employment opportunity and education for their children. This was a huge achievements for the ex bonded labour who were deprived of their rights and entitlements under various alibis for ages. Unfortunately, the lack of effective implementation of the commitment has remained a major challenge and as a result the great majority of ex bonded labour continue to suffer with no sign of relenting. Hence, the project jointly has implemented by the BASE as lead applicant and WVAF as partner organization have envisioned ameliorating the situation that has remained a long overdue. Moreover, the project will also contribute in achieving some of the goals of MDG by addressing the problem of ex-Kamaiya related with child labour and unemployment/underemployment through livelihood support, education, holding duty bearers to account and capacity building of Kamaiya leaders. It is implemented in five districts of Nepal.",

Cordaid went through a reorganization in 2012, redefined its strategy and main themes and organized itself in 12 business unites centered around one theme.

As a consequence disbursements cannot be planned accurately. Furthermore publishing planned disbursements might expose our partner organizations to security risks.",

Its approach is to offer safety, create opportunities together with local people, and to bring out the best in people.

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  \r\n\r\nFarm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Already familiar with Indigo’s profile and portfolio, Matt is excited to be working in ICT4D and looks forward to extending his knowledge of the field over the weeks and months ahead.\r\n\r\nSince graduating from the University of Bristol with a First Class BA (Hons) in Modern Languages, Matt has worked as a translator and film and television subtitler in Berlin and completed an MPhil on minority groups in the early German Democratic Republic. His academic background has provided him with a sound set of research skills, while his time at the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts has given him a solid grounding in philanthropy and the third sector.",

Our main technology is a modified rope and washer pump, which is low cost, easily maintained sustainable technology well suited to poor rural communities. We go further than just building water pumps as we train local community facilitators to educate and create awareness of good health and hygiene practices. ",

The Foundation’s vision is to “improve the lives of disadvantaged children and their communities globally”. This aspiration is realised through a range of initiatives designed to tackle development challenges in some of the poorest countries in the world.  Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. \r\nStars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. \r\nStars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean. The Awards are open to applications from the 100 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality (http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/apply/eligibility-2/). ",

In 2010 CSD contracted, through a competitive tendering process, a Fund Manager to manage the competition process for new grants and the day to day management of selected projects.  The contract was awarded to a Joint Venture between Triple Line Consulting and Crown Agents.  The GPAF and CSCF are managed between DFID and TLC/CA as follows.  DFID sets the strategic direction for the CSCF and the GPAF.  This includes aligning the overarching objectives of the funds to DFID’s Business Plan, agreeing the design of the competition and the funding mechanism and taking final decisions on grant selection.  The Fund Manager runs the funding competition process, including providing support to applicants and undertaking eligibility and initial quality assessments of applications against a criteria agreed with DFID.  Once DFID has selected projects for funding, the Fund Manager provides support to grant holders to put in place robust monitoring and evaluation systems, clear and justified budgets and project plans.  The Fund Manager then oversees the projects for the life of the grant, disbursing funding, monitoring financial and technical performance to ensure projects meet the set standard, and ensuring that any additional grant conditions are met.  The Fund Manager also leads on learning across the Funds to help the sector better understand what works, what doesn’t and why across the objectives supported by the Funds.  ",

The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions:\r\n\r\na) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations.\r\n\r\nWhen examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency.

OCT tracks all contributions received from donors to OCHA's annual extra-budget as well as all contributions to 'Specially Designated Contributions' (funds that are managed by OCHA but spent by third parties - including UN agencies and NGOs - for the implementation of humanitarian programmes). OCT tracks contributions from informal 'pipeline', through committed 'pledge' to final payment. It is also the online repository for all donor funding agreements. ",

It has become a beacon for Welsh efforts to help deliver the UN Millennium Development Goals to halve global poverty by 2015.\r\n\r\nThe main responsibility for international development within the United Kingdom lies with the UK Department for International Development (DfID). However, there is a demand within Wales for there to be an identifiable Welsh response to contributing to international development and addressing emergencies.\r\n\r\nActions that we take in support of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) must have a benefit to Wales as well as to the developing world. This imposes limits to the range of activities we can support but at the same time ensures that our actions will be more sustainable and based on equal partnerships.\r\nThe Wales for Africa programme seeks to:\r\n\r\n•encourage public sector placements and twinning which contribute to MDG delivery;\r\n\r\n•build the capacity of small Welsh International Development Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and aid the co-ordination of the sector as a whole in order to strengthen Wales’ impact on MDG delivery;\r\n\r\n•promote and encourage international sustainable development volunteering to the Welsh public and public sector staff;\r\n\r\n•work with partners to facilitate the work of diaspora communities in Wales in maximising their impact on MDG delivery in their home country;\r\n\r\n•promote best practice in Fair trade and ethical procurement across the public and private sector in Wales - making Wales a beacon of fair trade and ethical procurement in Europe.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact the Wales for Africa Team please email: walesforafrica@wales.gsi.gov.uk",

It has become a beacon for Welsh efforts to help deliver the UN Millennium Development Goals to halve global poverty by 2015. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe main responsibility for international development within the United Kingdom lies with the UK Department for International Development (DfID). However, there is a demand within Wales for there to be an identifiable Welsh response to contributing to international development and addressing emergencies.\r\n\r\nActions that we take in support of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) must have a benefit to Wales as well as to the developing world. This imposes limits to the range of activities we can support but at the same time ensures that our actions will be more sustainable and based on equal partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe Wales for Africa programme seeks to:\r\n\r\n•encourage public sector placements and twinning which contribute to MDG delivery; \r\n\r\n•build the capacity of small Welsh International Development Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and aid the co-ordination of the sector as a whole in order to strengthen Wales’ impact on MDG delivery; \r\n\r\n•promote and encourage international sustainable development volunteering to the Welsh public and public sector staff; \r\n\r\n•work with partners to facilitate the work of diaspora communities in Wales in maximising their impact on MDG delivery in their home country;\r\n \r\n•promote best practice in Fair trade and ethical procurement across the public and private sector in Wales - making Wales a beacon of fair trade and ethical procurement in Europe.\r\n",
